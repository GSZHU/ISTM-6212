    "# Project 02 - Due Friday, November 11 at 12pm\n",
    "\n",
    "*Objectives*: Gain experience loading a transactional dataset into a relational database model you define yourself and using SQL to explore its contents. Transform the data into a star schema, documenting the schema visually, and explore the transformed data analytically by writing and executing a number of SQL queries using common syntax and functions and describing your findings.  Gain practice working on these tasks with a partner.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Grading criteria*: The tasks should all be completed, and questions should all be answered with SQL queries, diagrams, and charts in the space provided, unless a text answer is requested.  The notebook itself should be completely reproducible at datanotebook.org, from start to finish: another person should be able to use the same code to obtain the same results as yours.  Note that you will receive no more than partial credit if you do not add text/markdown cells explaining your thinking at each major step in each problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Attestation*: **Work in pairs**.  At the end of your submitted notebook, identify the work each partner performed and attest that each contributed substantially to the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Deadline*: Friday, November 11, 12pm.  One member of each pair must submit your notebook to Blackboard; you should not both submit it separately.  You may each push a copy to your own GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup - select and obtain data\n",
    "\n",
    "The US City Open Data Census has a variety of [transactional data from all over the country](http://us-city.census.okfn.org/).  Select one topic and one city from this Census, download the data, and explain your reason for this choice before proceeding.  Provide a link to the web page for the data set you've chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "I strongly encourage you to select a dataset from among the following topics:  Crime, Property Assessment, Campaign Finance Contributions, Service Requests (311), and Web Analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "By *transactional* data I mean records at the grain of one event per business process.  In the case of Service Requests (311), for example, that would require data at the level of each individual report of a service request.  If this isn't clear, think about the bike trip data - each individual ride was included - and look for data at that level of event/process specificity.  Avoid data like the Connecticut boating data, which was summarized by year, not individual transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please aim for a dataset of at least 10,000 individual records, but less than 250,000 records.  A little more or a little less is okay, but try to stay within these limits."

How often would you need to update the data?  Could you easily automate any data cleaning steps?  What checks would you need to put in place to ensure quality?  Would humans need to be involved, or could you automate it all?\n",

As in the case of bike trips, where weather might provide an interesting added dimension/context not present in the original data, you can probably find another source of data to complement your own model.  Identify one such source and add it to your model, demonstrating its value with a few new queries."
